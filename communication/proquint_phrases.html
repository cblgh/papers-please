<h1>A Proposal for Proquints: Identifiers that are Readable, Spellable, and Pronounceable</h1>
<span id="author">Daniel Shawcross Wilkerson</span><br />
<span id="revision">version 1.0,</span>
26 January 2009
</div>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Identifiers (IDs) are pervasive throughout our modern life.  We
suggest that these IDs would be easier to manage and remember if they
were easily readable, spellable, and pronounceable.  As a solution to
this problem we propose using PRO-nouncable QUINT-uplets of
alternating unambiguous consonants and vowels: <em>proquints</em>.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Our life is full of identifying numbers.  However the number-ness of
these numbers is irrelevant.  A credit-card number is not a <em>number</em>
exactly &#8212; when was the last time you did arithmetic on one?  Mostly
these numbers are <em>identifiers</em>: their only function is to be unique.
The problem is, they are getting longer as the world of things that
must be uniquely identified gets larger: the number of things goes up,
previously disjoint contexts merge, and history gets longer.</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Dotted quads IP addresses, e.g. 127.0.0.1, will soon (someday?),
   with IPv6, be twice as long.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Eight hex-digit Memory addresses, e.g. 0xF074B0CD, will soon, with
   64-bit machines, be twice as long.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Nine-digit Social security numbers are already being re-used with
   obvious attendant problems.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>Most codes are designed to maximize information density.  Humans often
must manipulate identifiers personally and there are therefore other
dimensions to the problem that should also be considered.  Here our
goal here is not to have a narrow, "vertical", solution that is
optimized for only one dimension, such as information density, but a
broad "horizontal" solution that is a good solution for <em>all</em> of the
relevant concerns, especially those of <em>humans</em>.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In general what would help the humans would be if IDs were not only
unique, but were also that are readable, spellable, and pronounceable
and just generally convenient for a human to use &#8212; as well as being a
reasonably efficient information encoding.  We therefore propose
PRO-nouncable QUINT-uplets of alternating unambiguous consonants and
vowels, or "proquints", as the solution.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In this essay we first derive an initial naive solution from the
relevant concerns.  Next we review other aspects of human interaction
with the solution and thereby derive the details.  We then compute the
information density of the solution.  Finally we summarize the
resulting protocol.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_distinguishable_available_sounds_and_symbols">Distinguishable Available Sounds and Symbols</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>There is only so much Shannon entropy <strong>[Shannon-1948, Shannon-1949,
Shannon-1993, Shannon-1951]</strong> you can get by pushing air through
flapping organs originally purposed for eating and breathing.  We
assume it best to re-use the method to which natural language has
already converged.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Our initial idea is to encode numbers as strings of alternating
phonetically-unambiguous consonants and vowels.
<a href="http://www.antimoon.com/how/pronunc-soundsipa.htm">There seem to be</a>
<strong>[pronounce]</strong> 24 consonants and 20 vowels in English.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_pronunciation">It gets more
complex</a> <strong>[pronounce2]</strong> if you look more carefully.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Some consonants are too hard to encode or to hear the difference
between.  There are 16 unambiguous 1-letter consonants (omitting what
we consider to be the wrongly-categorized letter "r"):</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    b d f g h j k l m n p s t v w z,</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>and 3 more two-letter:</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    sh ch th.</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>Having 16 sounds gives 4 bits right there and all in a
single-character spelling, so we think sticking to the above
one-letter consonants is good.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>There are 6 unambiguous 1-letter vowels (again disagreeing with the
categorization of the letter "r"):</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    a e i o u r.</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>If we just had two more vowels we would have 8 sounds or 3 bits.  Then
we could use consonant-vowel order (reversing the pair) or stress
(indicated by, say, a capital letter) to get one more bit.  This would
yield a total of 8 bits for a consonant-vowel pair.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_serving_multiple_human_constraints">Serving Multiple Human Constraints</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Recall that the proquint goals are multiple and include readability
and spellability and just general convenience and general fitness to
the problem: this is a system to used by humans who do not like
complexity.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Therefore we think it is important to make the textual encoding of the
sounds simple, by</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
writing all proquints using the same character width,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
not introducing case differences to encode information, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
not using non-alpha chars to encode other vowels (@ for the "a" in
    "at").
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>Further, a simple (C=consonant, V=vowel) CVCVC
pronounceable-five-group or "proquint" feels right as a word.  In
fact, we can get rid of two of the vowels, say "e" and "r", and still
encode 2 bits in one vowel.  This method makes the information
contained in one proquint a convenient number:</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    (log2 (* 16.0 4.0 16.0 4.0 16.0))
    16.0</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>So four proquints suffices to encode 64 bits and two suffice for 32
bits.  We wonder why IP addresses aren't encoded this way &#8212; they sure
would be easier to remember.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Since one may also want to fall back on saying each letter separately
and therefore each should likely be a single syllable in English, we
eliminate "w", which as previously-mentioned was a source of ambiguity
already.  In its place we promote "r" to a consonant.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Getting rid of ambiguities between vowels is a good idea for making
this system more international, though there are persistent
difficulties: Japanese have difficulty distinguishing "l" and "r",
Hungarians have difficulty pronouncing "w", and "l" can easily sound
like a "w" (a mutation occurring in the history of my middle name).
My proof-readers have sent me many more examples from other languages
&#8212; attempting to eliminate all such ambiguities is impossible, but we
have prevented some of the worst ones above.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Some proquint sequences ending in "h" take some extra effort to
pronounce and hear, but since there is always exactly one consonant
where you expect one, there is less ambiguity than in natural spoken
English: if you don't hear a consonant when you expected one, it was
an "h", the empty consonant.  The only other option is to replace "h"
with "x" and we really can't say that doing so is an improvement: "x"
is usually pronounced as "ks" which is really a consonant cluster and
confuses the rhythm.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>There is another subtle reason not to use "x": the standard notation
for a hex string starts with a prefix that includes an "x" so it is
therefore possible to unambiguously distinguish between a proquint and
a hex string in standard notation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>A sequence of proquints should be separated by something standard,
such as dashes.  While the dash is intended to induce a pause, for
easy flow of pronunciation we suggest an unused vowel sound be used.
Since we don't use the vowel "e", we suggest the dash be pronounced as
"eh".</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>See the "Conclusion and Specification" section below for the full
specification of the resulting proquint coding scheme.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_information_density">Information Density</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>While information density is not the only goal, it is a concern for
any coding system.  Note that we get 16 bits out of 5 letters, which
gives us an proquint information density of:</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    (/ 16.0 5.0)
    3.2</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>This is close to the density of 4 for hexadecimal and almost the same
as the density 3.32 for decimal digits.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>However, note that unbroken strings of hex or decimal digits are quite
unreadable, and they are usually broken into groups of at most four,
whereas proquints are readable in groups of five.  Taking this into
account gives hex a density of 3.2, decimal 2.65, and proquint 2.86.</p></div>
<h3 id="_density_as_compared_to_credit_card_numbers">Density as Compared To Credit Card Numbers</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>In particular, why aren't credit card numbers proquints instead of
numbers?</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The density of four blocks of four decimal digits, including separators is</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    (/ (log2 (* 10000.0 10000.0 10000.0 10000.0 ))
       (+ (* 4 4) (* 3 1)))
    2.7974131325367266</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>The density of three blocks proquints, including separators is</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    (* 16.0 6.0 16.0 6.0 16.0)
    147456.0
    (/ (log2 (* 147456.0 147456.0 147456.0))
       (+ (* 3 5) (* 2 1)))
    3.0299867649604084</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<h3 id="_density_as_compared_to_english">Density as Compared To English</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="para"><p>Bruce Schneier says in "Applied Cryptography" <strong>[Schneier-1996,
pp. 233-234]</strong> that Shannon computed an entropy of 2.3 bits per letter
for 8-letter chunks; other computations getting lower numbers,
Schneier settling on 1.3 for general purposes.  So we are above the
information rate expected for English, but not dramatically so.  We
suspect the fact that proquints are more information-dense than
English is the reason proquints must be pronounced a bit more
carefully than English &#8212; there's no such thing as a free lunch.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_proquints_as_a_mnemonic_password_scheme">Proquints As A Mnemonic Password Scheme</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>It is a well-known problem that people often create weak passwords, at
least partly due to their desire to create mnemonic passwords.
Mnemonic schemes have been suggested but the information density /
password strength versus that of standard password schemes can be a
challenge to state precisely, as the useful entropy of a password
amounts only the entropy relative to the implied expectations encoded
in an attackers dictionary.  Various empirical studies have been made
<strong>[YBA-2000, KRC-2006]</strong>.  At least one method of generating random
pronounceable passwords have been shown to be insecure <strong>[GD-1994]</strong>.
Narayanan and Shmatikov <strong>[NS-2005]</strong> claim that "as long as passwords
remain human-memorable, they are vulnerable to "smart-dictionary"
attacks even when the space of potential passwords is large."</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Of course a simple scheme using proquints can generate passwords of
known strength that are still quite readable, spellable, and
pronounceable:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
generate random 32 (or 48 or 64 bits),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
convert them to two (or three or four) proquints, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
tell the user that's their password.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="para"><p>The extent to which a user would find a password so generated to be
mnemonic is still an open question.  Narayanan points out to me
<strong>[N-2009-p]</strong> that if users are allowed to regenerate passwords until
they find one that is particularly mnemonic then the strength of the
above password scheme may not be quite as imagined.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>We imagine one possible security threat is that proquints are rather
fun to pronounce, and we find ourselves doing so especially when we
are attempting to memorize or recall one.  Therefore perhaps users of
proquint-encoded passwords should be admonished to refrain from this
temptation.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_an_easy_path_to_adoption">An Easy Path to Adoption</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Any protocol that currently uses an opaque identifier somewhere can
immediately begin to use proquints by simply printing any such
identifiers in proquint form as well and accepting proquints as
alternatives to such identifiers.</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Debuggers could input and output memory addresses as proquints as
   an alternative to hex.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Network tools such as browsers, ping, netstat, traceroute,
   etc. could input and output proquints as an alternative to dotted
   quads.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Password generators could generate the proquint form, as above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hash functions such as sha1 could use proquints as as alternative
   notation for the hashvalue.  Tools that use hash values of objects
   as their identifiers, such as version control systems like
   monotone, mercurial, and git, could do the same.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tools that use public-key encryption could encode the
   public/private key-pairs as proquints.  It might actually be
   possible to memorize your public key if you chanted it enough
   times.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
